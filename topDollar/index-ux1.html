        <p>Using Easydollar, young Australians can manage all of their bills in one place. The concept
            is based on the
            belief that young people tend to lose track of all of their subscriptions, including those that are no
            longer needed, and therefore struggle to pay their bills on time. The project was made in collaboration with
            another UX designer. As part of the client brief, we were asked to suggest ways to improve the user
            experience of the current MVP before its official launch. Additionally, we conducted a study on the needs of
            the users so that the product could be better tailored to their needs. <br><br>
            Based on a first analysis of the prototype, we determined that it did not have enough features to satisfy
            early adopters. </p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li>One of the key features, direct payment through the app, was missing entirely.</li>

            <li>Automating the upload of bills, another key feature, was very complicated to set up.</li>

            <li>Users faced a long sign-up process which constituted a roadblock. </li>

        </ul>
        <p>As it stands, the current "MVP" was not a good "MVP" for obtaining meaningful feedback from users for future
            development.</p>

                <p>EasyDollar users sign up by scheduling a call on Calendly with an EasyDollar representative. During
                    this call, they receive instructions on auto-forwarding the bills email to the app.</p>

            <p>To improve EasyDollar's chances of success, and to get more meaningful feedback on the whole concept
                during the testing phase, we suggested the following changes:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Removing the phone call from the sign-up process and replacing it with a video tutorial of how to
                    set up auto-forwarding of emails to the app.</li>

                <li>To reduce the number of questions on the sign up from 10 to 5.</li>

                <li>Users can manually add expenses and bills that don't arrive via email by adding them manually. </li>

                <li>Connecting to a third-party payment website to pay the bills.</li>

                    <p>It was difficult for users to set up email auto-forwarding because of the phone call required. We
                        have replaced this with an instructional video showing how to set up the user's email account to
                        forward bills. This solution was cost-effective due to budget constraints. It may be necessary
                        for EasyDollar to consider other options in uploading bills in the long run. We could, for
                        example, develop a link to allow billers to send bills directly to EasyDollar.

            <h1 class="subtitle underline">User testing findings</h1>

            <h1 class="subtitle under-line">The current prototype was usable.</h1>
            <p> The MVP has never been tested with
                potentials users before. Thus, we first looked into the interface design of the current prototype. We
                conducted a usability test on 5 users and their feedback was that the interface design was simple and
                clean. They could complete the required tasks. </p>

            <h1 class="subtitle">Usable yet not useful.</h1>
            <p>During the usability testing, we found that users were not excited about this app. Most of the users
                settled bills by direct debit and through the bank apps, they found the functionality of the current
                could offer
                more.

            <h1></h1>
            <p>There are too few features in EasyDollar's current MVP to call it a MVP. MVPs are products with just
                enough functionality to satisfy early users and gather feedback for future improvement. <br><br>
                Imagine that your users need to move from point A to point B. If you provide them with a wheel, they
                won't be able to reach their destination. It is unlikely that they would sign up for this product.
                Providing them with a skateboard instead of a wheel would allow them to reach their destination even if
                it isn't as good as a car. The product could then be complemented with other features, such as a
                stearing wheel, a rain cover, to meet all their needs.</p>

            <div class="pic">
                <img src="./img/MVP-5.jpg" alt="">
            </div>


            <p>Similarly, when building an MVP you still
                need to study the needs, interests, and demographic characteristics of the
                target audience. Then you need to review all the features that can be implemented and select the
                essential ones. </p>

            <h1 class="subtitle">User testing</h1>

            <p>EasyDollar was introduced with the mission to empower individuals to feel confident about their finances
                and in control of their
                spending by consolidating and paying their bills with a convenient and easy-to-understand app.</p>
            <p>“I would like your help in improving the user experience of the current MVP.”
                Our client would like us to provide a list of suggestions to improve the user experience of the current
                MVP before its official launch.</p>
            <p>We introduced the UX
                honeycomb to our client.
                There were 7 essential considerations in order to create a good user experience and we needed to find a
                sweet spot between
                these various areas. The UX honeycomb provided us with a direction for this project and ensured that we
                and our client had the
                same metric to evaluate the current MVP.</p>

        <section class="testing">
            <h1 class="subtitle">Survey to find out what users need.</h1>
            <p>To better understand the needs of users, a survey was conducted on 30 candidates.</p>

            <div class="pic">
                <img src="./img/doshy-graphs.jpg" alt="" class="table">
            </div>

            <p>From the graphs, you can see that:</p>
            <ul class="list">

                <li>Among the candidates, only 10% are unhappy with how they monitor their bills.</li>

                <li>Only a quarter of them had more than five bills.</li>

                <li>Direct debit is used by the majority of them whenever possible.</li>

                <li>Half of them want to know if their suppliers are offering them the best deals.</li>

                <li>Almost half share their bills with someone, and they are dissatisfied with the way they do it.</li>

            </ul>

            <p>Overall, EasyDollar would satisfy the needs of a small market niche.</p>

            <h1 class="subtitle">Interviews</h1>
            <p>During our interviews with five candidates, we discovered that the following two features are critical to
                EasyDollar's success: </p>
            <ul class="list">

                <li>A feature that lets users know if they are getting the best deal from their suppliers.</li>

                <li>A feature that lets them share bills in a clear and efficient manner
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="subtitle">Conclusion</h1>
            <p> The more potential users we talked to in this project, the more we realized EasyDollar needed more
                research
                and a unique selling point. In the end, our client was very satisfied with the outcome of our one-week
                sprint. Without diving deep into the real needs of the real users, the product would fail and lose the
                opportunity to convert early adopters into long-term customers.
